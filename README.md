anki decks for a levels - may add more stuff in the future idk

IMPORTANT: some of the cards in these decks use the 'Image Occlusion Enhanced' add-on - if you do not have this, I doubt these cards will work.

ALSO the positioning of cards in this deck is sort of messed up, so I would recommend SUSPENDING ALL CARDS and then unsuspending them as you want to learn them - all cards are tagged by specification point so you can easily un-suspend as you go through topics
